# Setup Instructions for Darkflame Universe (Google Cloud Setup)

The following is a guide to setting up a functioning Darkflame Universe server instance running in the cloud, which has several key benefits:

- These steps don't vary based on what kind of computer you have.
- You can easily start over if you mess up (just delete the instance).
- The server can continue to run even if you turn off your PC.

The downside to this method is that it does technically cost money. You will have to provide a payment method with Google. However, there is a one-year trial which gives $300 in credits, and the smallest instance is about $5 a month.
