LEGO Universe was a kid-friendly massively-multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG), developed by The LEGO Group, which was available to players between October 2010 and January 2012. It featured a variety of minigames such as racing, a player housing system that allowed players to build with LEGO bricks, and action-packed combat against the Maelstrom to help save Imagination.

On December 5th, 2021, the Darkflame Universe project released an open-source server emulator for LEGO Universe, which makes the original game fully playable for small groups of friends.
